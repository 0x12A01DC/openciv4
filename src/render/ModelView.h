// A model as the screens show it on its own (the Civilopedia's units, buildings, improvements
// and resources, the main interface's selected unit): the art's NIF in its idle (a unit's KFM
// event 1000, else the file's own controllers), turned as the script asks (x: tilted towards
// the viewer, z: turned about its up axis, degrees), as large as its picture allows times the
// script's scale, lit from the front, on nothing (the panel shows through). A scene with a
// camera of its own (the religions' "movies": a shrine, its camera moving round it) is seen
// through that camera instead (looking at its ".Target" node when it has one). With layers
// ("camera=<node>;<event code>:<mode>;...") it plays those clips of its KFM together instead of
// its idle, each held at its end (e), looped (l) or once from the start (o), through the camera
// on that node: the spaceship screen's launch pad, its parts shown as the ship is built.

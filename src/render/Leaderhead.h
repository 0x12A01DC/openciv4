// A leader's head as the original's screens show it (diplomacy, the Civilopedia's leaders,
// Dawn of Man): the leader's model and its background scene (the art's NIF, KFM and
// background KFM), drawn through the camera the model has (its NiCamera) and lit by its key
// light, into a picture of its own the screens draw where the head goes. The greeting
// first, then the idle of its attitude; the gestures it is asked for (LeaderheadAction, which
// are the KFM's event codes: greeting 0, the idles from friendly 1 to furious 5, disagree 6,
// agree 7), then that idle again.

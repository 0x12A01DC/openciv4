#pragma once

// The diplomacy screen's engine side, as the original EXE has it. The DLL opens it: for an AI
// that contacts the player (beginDiplomacy) and for the player who contacts an AI (the
// interface's diplomacy queue); the leader greets with the AI's greeting when the DLL gives
// no comment, or refuses to talk. A talk that comes while another is up, or a popup, waits in
// the player's own queue (CvPlayer::addDiplomacy, kept in saves as in the original).
//
// What the leader says and what the player can answer are the game's script's
// (CvDiplomacyInterface and CvDiplomacy.py, through the engine's CyDiplomacy: oc4screens.py
// draws the screen); this keeps them and the trade table: both players' items
// (CvPlayer::buildTradeTable and updateTradeList, the items' texts and headings from the DLL),
// the two offers ("ours" the player's, "theirs" the leader's) and whose proposal they are. The
// AI judges an offer and makes one through its virtual functions (AI_considerOffer,
// AI_counterPropose) as the original EXE calls them; a deal is the game's (implementDeal).
